## Terminologies
When talking about words, we can mean several different things: lemmas, word types and word tokens:
* **Lemma** - an identifier of a set of lexical forms sharing the same stem (*run* is the lemma for *runs* and *running*), a dictionary form of a word.
* **Word type** - a distinct unit in a text (all the instances of *runs* are counted once).
* **Word token** - every instance of word occurrence (every instance of *runs* counted as a separate word token).
* **Tokenization** - a process of separating out word tokens from text
* **Lemmatization** - a process of assigning a group of word forms their lemma, and further separating out these lemmas from text

## Side notes
* In information theory, the more likely an event to occur, the less information it contains. Thus, if an event is not a surprise, it's simply "old news". For some natural language applications, it means that words like to and the don't tell anything important about a text. They are not helpful in recognising its topic or its author.
